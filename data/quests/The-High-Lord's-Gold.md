## **The High Lord's Gold *(Warrior Edition*)**

### **Details ~**

*You have been teleported to the top floor of the Wizard's Tower in Northern Gileanor. You look around but see no exit.
All that lays in front of you is a tarnished bronze scimitar -- and a fierce Red Dragon.*

*You reach down to retrieve the weapon, and are forced to dodge the first attack from the dragon. Wielding the scimitar
confidently, you realize that your only chance at survival is to stand and fight.*

### **Requirements ~**

Slay the enraged dragon and loot the gold. Upon your completion, you will be teleported back to Gileanor, and greeted by
Vortigern with your reward.

### **Hints ~**

*Strike hard, young Warrior, for the fate of Gileanor rests upon your shoulders.* ~ High Lord Vortigern

### **Rewards ~**

**100 Gold**  
**Level 2 Boost**
